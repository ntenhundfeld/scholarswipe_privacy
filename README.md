 Privacy Policy for ScholarSwipe

  Effective Date: February 6, 2026

  ScholarSwipe ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in the ScholarSwipe mobile application.


  1. No Data Collection
  ScholarSwipe is designed with a "Privacy First" architecture.
   * No Personal Information: We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, such as your name, email address, phone number, or location.
   * No Tracking: We do not use any third-party analytics, tracking tools, or advertising identifiers.
   * No Accounts: You are not required to create an account with us to use the app.


  2. Information Stored Locally and in iCloud
  All data you generate within the app—including your research topics, followed authors, swiped papers, and your saved library—is stored exclusively in two places:
   * On your device: In the app’s local data directory.
   * In your personal iCloud: If you have iCloud enabled, your data file is stored in your own iCloud "Ubiquitous Container" to allow for syncing between your devices (e.g., iPhone and iPad).

  We have no access to this data. Only you, through your Apple ID and devices, can access your iCloud storage.


  3. Third-Party Services
  ScholarSwipe fetches research data from public APIs provided by arXiv, CrossRef, and PubMed.
   * When the app fetches research papers, your device makes a direct request to these services. These services may see your IP address as part of a standard web request, but ScholarSwipe does not provide
     them with any personal identifiers.
   * If you choose to use the Zotero or Mendeley export features, you will be asked to provide your own API keys or login via their secure portals. ScholarSwipe stores these credentials locally on your
     device to facilitate the connection; we never see or store these credentials on any servers we control.


  4. Children’s Privacy
  Our app does not collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. ScholarSwipe is safe for use by researchers and students of all ages.


  5. Changes to This Policy
  We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. Because we do not collect user contact information, we
  recommend checking this policy periodically for updates.
